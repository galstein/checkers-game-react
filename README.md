1. Two players play against each other.
2. Select a checker to move it. Then select an empty tile. The checker will move if it's a legal move.
3. The game auto switches the player turn once you've completed all moves for that turn. Title color changes accordingly.
4. If there is an option to eat - it is a must!
5. If there is an option to eat after eating (double jump) - this is also a must.
6. If a checker reaches the opposite end of the board then the checker will become a king and can move in both directions.
7. A king can only eat a checker who is next to it.
8. The game will end once one of the players has no more legal moves.
